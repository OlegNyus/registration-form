# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the application locally:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd registration-form
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
   This will start the development server at `http://localhost:5173`

4. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```
   This will create a `dist` folder with the production build

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run lint` - Runs ESLint to check code quality
- `npm run preview` - Locally preview the production build

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add any necessary environment variables:
