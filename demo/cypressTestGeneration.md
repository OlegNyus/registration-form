I have Cypress installed and configured. Write code for ALL test cases in the attached file. Make sure, cover all test cases and all requirements. All test must be in one spec file. If we need Custom command then make an instruction where to put that. The goal is to copy/paste code to the existing Cypress framework and run it. All should work.

Automate only test cases with "Yes" in the "Cypress Automation" column.
Test file spec name: registration-form.cy.js
